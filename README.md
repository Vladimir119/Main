# UnorderedMap
There is data structure - unordered_map in this repository.
It is a standard data structure that uses a hash to store quick access to data.
It supports an iterator, a custom allocator, and a custom hash function. It also support template data type, but for some data type you need use a non-standart hashfunction!
# Implementation features
There are some ways of realization map. First from it is using chain, but it is false way, because for iterator we can not supported this point. Second way uses list for iteration. I implemented this way with open addressing.
